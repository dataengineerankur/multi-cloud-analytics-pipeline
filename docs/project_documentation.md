# Project Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details of a data pipeline designed to process and integrate data from multiple sources: customer data, transaction data, and fiscal calendar. The objective is to provide a consolidated dataset in Delta Lake format that is optimized for query performance and ready for analytical consumption in data warehouses.

## High-Level Design

### Architecture
The pipeline architecture is built to manage large volumes of data efficiently and effectively, ensuring scalability, availability, and security:

- **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)**: Data is extracted from S3, transformed using Spark, and loaded into Delta Lake format.
- **Data Quality Validation**: Comprehensive validation using PyDeequ framework to ensure data integrity and business rule compliance.
- **Enrichment and Extension**: Data is enhanced with additional computations including customer segmentation, sales analytics, and business metrics.
- **Mitigation of Risks**: Implementing Delta Lake ensures ACID transactions, data versioning, and consistent data across the pipeline.
- **Scalability and Availability**: Leveraging Databricks and Apache Spark to handle varying loads and ensure data availability.
- **Security**: Utilizing AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access and ensure data security across all components.
- **Orchestration and Workflow**: Automated workflows using Apache Airflow to manage the pipeline's lifecycle and handle dependencies.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring through Spark UI, Airflow UI, and AWS CloudWatch.

### Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark 3.3**: Distributed data processing engine
- **AWS S3**: Cloud object storage for raw and processed data
- **Delta Lake**: Open-source storage layer providing ACID transactions
- **Databricks**: Unified analytics platform for big data and machine learning
- **PyDeequ**: Data quality validation framework built on Apache Spark
- **Apache Airflow 2.7**: Workflow orchestration platform

- **Amazon Redshift**: Cloud data warehouse for analytics
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and access management
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging service

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion
Data is loaded from AWS S3 where raw customer, transaction, and fiscal calendar data reside:
- **Customer Data**: Personal information, contact details, and customer attributes
- **Transaction Data**: Sales transactions with product details, amounts, and timestamps
- **Fiscal Calendar**: Date dimensions for time-based analytics

The ingestion process converts all data to Delta Lake format for optimized storage and query performance.

### 2. Data Quality Validation
Comprehensive data quality checks using PyDeequ framework:
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensuring required fields are not null
- **Uniqueness Validation**: Verifying primary key constraints
- **Data Type Validation**: Confirming correct data types and formats
- **Business Rule Validation**: Custom rules for email formats, positive amounts, and referential integrity
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers and unexpected patterns

### 3. Data Transformation
Multi-stage transformation process creating dimensional and fact tables:
- **Dimension Tables**: Customer, product, and calendar dimensions with slowly changing dimension (SCD) support
- **Fact Table**: Transaction facts with calculated measures and business rules
- **Business Logic Implementation**: 
  - Customer segmentation (High/Medium/Low value based on $10K threshold)
  - Refund processing with 10% restocking fee calculation
  - Large order flagging ($5K threshold)
  - Transaction type classification (Sale/Refund based on amount sign)

### 4. Data Storage and Optimization
The transformed data is stored in Delta Lake with performance optimizations:
- **OPTIMIZE**: Compacting small files for better query performance
- **ZORDER**: Organizing data by frequently queried columns
- **VACUUM**: Removing outdated files beyond retention period
- **Partitioning**: Strategic partitioning by date for time-based queries

### 5. Data Warehouse Loading
Processed data is exported to Amazon Redshift for analytical consumption:
- **Dimensional Model**: Star schema with proper relationships
- **Data Types**: Optimized data types for Redshift performance
- **Compression**: Column compression for storage efficiency
- **Distribution Keys**: Proper distribution for join performance

### 6. Analytics Generation
Creation of pre-aggregated analytics tables for BI consumption:
- **Sales Analytics**: Weekly, monthly, quarterly sales summaries
- **Refunds Analytics**: Refund tracking with restocking fees
- **Product Analytics**: Product family sales rankings
- **Regional Analytics**: Geographic performance comparisons
- **Customer Analytics**: Customer segmentation and top spender analysis

## Data Model

### Source Data Schema
- **Customer Data**: customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip_code
- **Transaction Data**: transaction_id, customer_id, product_id, product_name, product_family, amount, transaction_date, region
- **Fiscal Calendar**: date, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter, fiscal_month, fiscal_week

### Target Data Model
- **dim_customer**: Customer dimension with segmentation
- **dim_product**: Product dimension with family groupings
- **dim_calendar**: Date dimension with fiscal attributes
- **fact_transactions**: Transaction facts with calculated measures
- **Analytics Tables**: Pre-aggregated tables for specific business needs

## Data Quality Framework

### Validation Rules
1. **Completeness**: All required fields must be populated
2. **Uniqueness**: Primary keys must be unique across datasets
3. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key relationships must be valid
